# TRY Creative Tech - Swipe challenge

This is a small test to look at your structure, workflow and code skills as a developer. We are looking for a pixel perfect design implementation with your own touch to the functionality.

## Requirements

You are free to use whatever stack you want to complete the challenge. To submit the challenge we would like a link to a GitHub repo containing short and structured commits and some documentation of your setup.

## Thoughts

When I tried to do a GET call to the provided API, I wasn't getting any data back and I thought this was weird. After a few messing around in the chrome console I could see that the request was blocked by CORS policy. Which I learned you cannot get access unless you're making calls from Origin.

- Don't know if I need to post all of the data or just status
- Can't post to the API endpoint because CORS is blocking
- The images dont work.

I think its impossible to get something to fit within the proved card image, so gonig to do my own card design and add that

## Made with

NextJS, React Swiper, useHooks-ts(localstorage), custom hook
